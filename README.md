# FdF
3D Render Program
Here are some learnings I had while doing FdF:
 - This is a great blog series to learn minilibx: https://aurelienbrabant.fr/blog/getting-started-with-the-minilibx Especially for learning how to correctly handle memory leaks.
 - This is a fantastic Maths channel and intro to linear algebra and matrices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B
 - The example image in the subject.pdf of FdF is NOT an example for isometric projection. It seems like there's a mistake in the subject.pdf as confirmed by multiple students on Slack.
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Iz0XJY-Qk he explains 3D rendering & rotating, so fun & good as @Gabriel Wolf explaining Rush01 ðŸ¤£
